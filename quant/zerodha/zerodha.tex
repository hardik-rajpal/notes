\section{What To Expect}
Trading techniques, not trading systems, are of the sort:
\begin{itemize}
    \item System-Deduction-based trading
    \item Trade because your gut says so
    \item Trade because my friend says so
    \item Trade because the guy on TV says so
    \item Trade because my broker says so
\end{itemize}
A trading system (1) takes some inputs from the market, (2) runs specific logic, implemented
by you and (3) gives you an output. The onus of deciding whether or not to make
the trade is still on the human trader.\\
The module plans to discuss:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pair trading
    \item Volatility based Delta hedging
    \item Calendar spreads
    \item Momentum strategy (Portfolio approach)
\end{enumerate}
No trading system is complete without backtesting, which is not covered by this module.
