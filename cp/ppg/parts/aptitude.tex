\section{Aptitude Test Pointers}
\subsection{Number Sequence}
These questions are hella annoying. So, I've written down a list of possibilities 
here that I can refer to while cheating in the test. (That's a joke.)
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A.P, G.P, AGP. HP.
    \item Check difference, 2nd difference ...
    \item Incorporating a well-known series.
    \item Consider $x^{f(x)}$ for monotonic series with large gaps.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Primes
        \item Fibonacci (spot by nth difference - n-1th difference)
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Two series of alternating numbers interleaved or alternating next() function.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The next function alternates between constant difference and constant factor.
        \item The next function alternates between f(x)=ax+d and g(x)=bx+c
    \end{enumerate}
    \item If the numbers go up and down, it's a result of interleaving or the relation between neighbours keeps switching between two functions.
    \item Given alphabet series,
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Convert to positions and reverse positions.
        \item Consider vowel and consonant relations.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The sequence might involve manipulating a permutation of the previous element lmao.
\end{enumerate}
